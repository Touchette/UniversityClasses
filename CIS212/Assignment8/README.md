# Eighth Assignment in CIS 212
CIS 212 Assignment Eight, completed November 2017. This program simulates a network via a server program and a client program.

# Regular
The regular version of this program simulates the network relationship via a server that waits upon a client to send it a list of integers. The user inputs these integers via a scanner and then sends via a specialized input. Once the server receives the list of integers, it will return (by sending to the client) the list of prime numbers that were contained in the given list. Then the program will exit.

# Extra
The extra credit version of this project simulates the same relationship that the regular version does, but this time it simulates a client that sends a random list of integers to the server once on a set interval. The user can decide when to start this process, as well as when to pause it and end it, via a scanner and specialized inputs.
